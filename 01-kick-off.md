# Educat and the future of education. 

Everyone needs to learn. Most of us never learned how to do it properly. Even those who finish university with perfect scores, can struggle to pivot later in life. It's quite rare to find people who are in love with their ability to learn and acquire new skills. 

A while ago, I have started a collaboration with Slava, with aim of developing 3D game engine, that will specialise at creation of educational games. Combination of factors, such as health issues, and additional projects made it difficult for me to contribute as much as I'd love to. 

Now I hope to change it, as finally I'm starting to get into a healthy state, when sitting routinely behind the computer is an option. With that being said, let's return to our ideas.

Our attention might be the most precious thing we have. We need to pay attention to certain sensory inputs in order to learn. When learning a musicial instrument, I need to listen to the acoustic wave, which results from the movement of my fingers and hands. If I do it well enough, I'm progressing on my learning yourney. 

To pay attention properly is not an easy task, but when it comes to learning, the act of paying attention at all, might be the main limiting factor. We get tired after 5 minutes, because of over-focus. Demotivated in 10 minutes, because it's not getting better, and burned out in 20 minutes. 
Anyone with good teachers and mentors can perform very well in the real world. It's intuitive for us to learn from other people, especialle if we find them interesting, competent and knowledgable. Especially in less developed regions, as of today, I'd say more than 4b people, lack access to good teachers and mentors in the various areas they want to develop in. 

In an ideal world, we would close our eyes, develop a wish of what we want to learn, and teacher as good as Richard Feynman would appear in front of us, ready to help us on our journey. Having well-trained full-time teacher for every student is not possible in this day and age. Maybe in the future, the combination of tesla robot 69 and GPT-100, and scale the production sufficiently. So it will become one of the basic human rights, and everyone will get one for free...

Until then, we have decided to focus on the second best thing. Our first observation was that human attention can be hacked by various ways. For example, social media can do it, by leveraging our natural drive for novelty and social comparission. Video-games do it by immersing us in a real-time visual and autitory inputs, akin to movies, but with added benefit of interactivity. 

The most popular educational medium, as of today, seems to be video. Which is a passive medium, unless the student is actively taking notes. It's similar to sitting in a big lecture hall. If we are lucky, the speaker is supported by a good presentation, or graphics that will make it easier to pay attention and remember. 

Software has a benefit of being easily scalable. Once it's developed, it can run on many machines, without additional cost to the developer. Only the client needs to pay for the computational power, which can be quite low in standard applications. Any progress on making it easier for people to learn new things, in the form of software can be highly valuable for the world. Especially in cases where the software is free to use, or affordable. 

We have decided to bridge the gap between modern video games and educational content. It's a long journey and we are barely starting. Current infrastructure seems to be surprisingly weak, as the biggest innovation in the software education space, still seems to be spaced repetition (Anki), ability to take digital notes.

We are looking for C++ developers, educators, game designers, and other enthusiasts to join our startup efforts. Email me if you are interested to learn more! :)
